CS410 Final Project - 

Team: Smriti Srinivasan, Juliano Dicarlo, Llorente, Kelly Lin


First, open the zip file. Inside, there should be this README, the Python notebook, and two CSVs.

Please open all the content on Jupyter Notebook. For the CSVs, open them seperately-- do not keep them in the data folder in Jupyter Notebook. All installations are done in a way where it works on Jupyter Notebook. 


Please run until "# ATTEMPT ONE: COLOURED HEAT MAP - NOT THE FINAL VERSION", and from "# THIS IS THE FINAL VERSION!!"


To find the key model, please cmd+F (or ctrl+f) "# THIS IS THE FINAL VERSION!!" to see and run the final version model. The code above it includes an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and prior attempts to make the final product. The code below also involves other attempts that do not fit what we believe to need.




To read the final product - example for ease:


Upon clicking on a marker, you should see the "Dominant Issue," which is the issue that the tweets from the city find the most important. For Chicago, it says the following:


"City: Chicago
Dominant Issue: Race and ethnic inequality
Alignments:
negative toward Biden: 26
positive toward Biden: 15
positive toward Trump: 2
negative toward Trump: 2"


This means that the dominant issue is "Race and ethnic inequality." It also means that out of the 5000 top-liked tweets, Chicago had 45 (adding together 26+15+2+2) tweets regarding the 2020 election that made it in the top-5000 tweets. 26 of the 45 have a negative sentiment towards Biden, 15 have a positive sentiment towards Biden, 2 have a positive sentiment towards Trump and 2 have a negative sentiment towards Trump.
